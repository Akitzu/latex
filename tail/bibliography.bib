	abstract = {The radial electric field in the plasma edge is studied in the Large Helical Device (LHD) experiments. When magnetic field lines become stochastic or open at the plasma edge and connected to the vessel, electrons are lost faster than ions along these field lines. Then, a positive electric field appears in the plasma edge. The radial electric field profile can be used to detect the effective plasma boundary. Magnetic topology is an important issue in stellarator and tokamak research because the 3D boundary has the important role of controlling MHD edge stability with respect to ELMs, and plasma detachment. Since the stochastic magnetic field layer can be controlled in the LHD by changing the preset vacuum magnetic axis, this device is a good platform to study the properties of the radial electric field that appear with the different stochastic layer width. Two magnetic configurations with different widths of the stochastic layer as simulated in vacuum are studied for low-β discharges. It has been found that a positive electric field appeared outside of the last closed flux surface. In fact the positions of the positive electric field are found in the boundary between of the stochastic layer and the scrape-off layer. To understand where is the boundary of the stochastic layer and the scrape-off layer, the magnetic field lines are analyzed statistically. The variance of the magnetic field lines in the stochastic layer is increased outwards for both configurations. However, the skewness, which means the asymmetry of the distribution of the magnetic field line, increases for only one configuration. If the skewness is large, the connection length becomes effectively short. Since that is consistent with the experimental observation, the radial electric field can be considered as an index of the magnetic topology.},

The development path for stellarators may be faster and cheaper than for tokamaks: stellarators are amenable to computer design validated by moderate scale experiments to circumvent issues that impede fusion development. This is distinct from the empirical explorations required to find an acceptable nonlinear, self-organized state of a tokamak. Fusion plasmas can be designed and controlled in stellarators in ways that are not possible in tokamaks. This paper outlines computational studies that could be carried at low cost during the next few years that would clarify the reactor potential of the stellarator and are needed for rational planning of the fusion program.},

For the finite beta equilibrium, the pressure-induced perturbed field breaks the nested flux surfaces, and the stochastization of the magnetic field appears in the region of the strong magnetic shear. The stochastization penetrates into the plasma core due to the increased beta and the effective plasma confinement degrades; in other words, the effective plasma volume shrinks. The stochastization strongly depends on the profile shape of the plasma pressure. Since the pressure gradient drives the Pfirsch–Schlüter current, the pressure profile affects the stochastization of the magnetic field. In order to understand the equilibrium beta limit due to the stochastization of the magnetic field, the profile shape of the plasma pressure is an important factor.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments on DIII-D have demonstrated that having a toroidally-monochromatic spectral content of edge-resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) is not a necessary condition for suppression of edge localized modes (ELMs). Robust ELM suppression has been reproducibly obtained on DIII-D during experiments in which various non-axisymmetric coil loops were turned off pseudo-randomly producing a variety of , , and spectral contributions. It was shown that RMP ELM suppression could be achieved with as few as 5 out of 12 internal coil loops (I-coils) on DIII-D at similar coil currents and with good plasma confinement. Linear MHD plasma response (m3dc1, ipec, mars) and vacuum (surfmn, trip3d) modelling have been performed in order to understand the effects of the perturbation spectrum on the plasma response and ELM suppression. The results suggest that reduction of the dominant perturbation field is compensated by increased field in the plasma that may lead to RMP ELM suppression at lower levels of perturbative magnetic flux from the I-coils. These results provide additional confidence that ITER may be capable of RMP ELM suppression in the event of multiple internal coil failures.},

The action principles for magnetic field lines and for Hamiltonian mechanics are recalled to be analogous. It is shown that the first one can be rigorously proved from first principles without analytical calculations. Not only the action principles are analogous, but also a change of canonical coordinates is recalled to be equivalent to a change of gauge. Furthermore, using the vector potential makes obvious the freedom in the choice of “time” for describing Hamiltonian dynamics. These features may be used for a new pedagogical and intuitive introduction to Hamiltonian mechanics. In the context of confined magnetic fields, the action principle for magnetic field lines makes practical calculations simpler and safer, with an intuitive background and allowing to keep a high degree of generality, as shown in the practical example of the calculation of the width of a magnetic island, analytically derived without any need of abstract Fourier components and independently of the choice of coordinates. Moreover, a new formula provides explicitly the Boozer and Hamada magnetic coordinates from action-angle coordinates.},

	abstract = {Small non-axisymmetric perturbations of poloidally diverted tokamaks create edge stochastic magnetic field lines that connect to material surfaces such as those in the divertors. Separatrix structure calculations show that the distribution of stochastic field lines on the vessel walls is closely related to the topology of homoclinic tangles formed in the perturbed system. Since these tangles prescribe how the stochastic fields are organized, they are of significant practical interest in tokamak experiments. Experimental measurements of heat and particle distributions on plasma facing surfaces sometimes show split peak patterns that are consistent with the presence of stochasticity and homoclinic tangles. These split peaks are often observed during locked modes and other types of edge instabilities. They are also observed when perturbation fields from magnetohydrodynamic control coils are pulsed during a plasma discharge. Numerical modeling of the perturbation field from these control coils shows that the homoclinic tangle produced by a coil pulse is not always large enough to produce the splitting patterns observed. Nevertheless, there is a clear correlation between the coil pulses and the appearance of the split profiles. These results suggest the presence of the plasma amplification mechanism that enhances the size of the non-resonant homoclinic tangles.},

	abstract = {Two mapping methods to study magnetic field lines near the separatrix of poloidal divertor tokamaks in the presence of external non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations are proposed. The first mapping method is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of field line equations in the Boozer coordinates and solving it by the canonical transformation of variables (Abdullaev et al 1999 Phys. Plasmas 6 153). The second mapping is a canonical mapping near the separatrix which is constructed using the recently developed method (Abdullaev 2004 Phys. Rev. E 70 064202, Abdullaev 2005 Phys. Rev. E 72 064202). We construct the corresponding mappings for magnetic field lines in divertor tokamaks in the presence of non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations. The mappings are applied to study the properties of open stochastic field lines near the separatrix for the wire model of the plasma. Poincaré sections, the so-called laminar and magnetic footprint plot (a contour plot of wall to wall connections lengths) in the plasma region and on the divertor plates are obtained. The quasilinear diffusion coefficients of field lines are also estimated.},

	abstract = {The topological structure and the statistical properties of stochastic magnetic fields are investigated on the basis of the so called tokamap. First, a monotonic safety factor (q-profile) is assumed. As it is demonstrated, the transition from the continuous model to the discrete mapping in its symmetric form is essential, not only for the symplectic structure, but also for the precise values characterizing the transition to chaos (e.g. the break-up of the KAM surfaces) in applications. Statistical properties of the symmetric tokamap, such as escape rates and anomalous diffusion properties, are being presented. By a systematic procedure the stable and unstable manifolds of the periodic hyperbolic fixed points and the resulting homoclinic tangles (stochastic layers) are determined. The latter are important for the magnetic field line transport. For a non-monotonic q-profile, the differences between the symmetric and non-symmetric revtokamap become also significant. The symmetric revtokamap represents an open nonlinear dynamical system which is characterized here with the relevant tools. (© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {Frequency Map Analysis is a numerical method based on refined Fourier techniques which provides a clear representation of the global dynamics of many multi-dimensional systems, and which is particularly adapted for systems of 3-degrees of freedom and more. This method relies heavily on the possibility of making accurate quasiperiodic approximations of of quasiperiodic signal given in a numerical way. In the present paper, we will describe the basis of the frequency analysis method, focussing on the quasi periodic approximation techniques. Application of these methods for the study of the global dynamics and chaotic diffusion of Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps in different domains can be found in (Laskar, 1988, 1990, Laskar and Robutel, 1993, Robutel and Laskar, 2001, Nesvorny and Ferraz-Mello, 1997) for solar system dynamics, and in (Papaphilippou and Laskar, 1996, 1998, Laskar, 2000, Wachlin and Ferraz-Mello, 1998, Valluri and Merritt, 1998, Merritt and Valluri, 1999) for galactic dynamics. The method has been particularly successful for its application in particle accelerators (Dumas and Laskar, 1993, Laskar and Robin, 1996, Robin et al., 2000, Comunian et al., 2001, Papaphilippou and Zimmermann, 2002, Steier et al., 2002), and was also used for the understanding of atomic physics (Milczewski et al., 1997), or more general dynamical system issues (Laskar et al., 1992, Laskar, 1993, 1999, Chandre et al., 2001).},

Such fields are used to confine fusion plasmas in stellarators, where in contrast to tokamaks and reversed-field pinches the magnetic field generally does not possess any continuous symmetry. The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion. In this article, the mathematical apparatus to describe stellarator plasmas is developed from first principles and basic elements underlying confinement optimization are introduced.},

This paper surveys the considerable progress on this problem over the past thirty years. Primary measures of transport for volume-preserving maps include the exiting and incoming fluxes to a region. For area-preserving maps, transport is impeded by curves formed from invariant manifolds that form partial barriers, e.g., stable and unstable manifolds bounding a resonance zone or cantori, the remnants of destroyed invariant tori. When the map is exact volume preserving, a Lagrangian differential form can be used to reduce the computation of fluxes to finding a difference between the actions of certain key orbits, such as homoclinic orbits to a saddle or to a cantorus. Given a partition of phase space into regions bounded by partial barriers, a Markov tree model of transport explains key observations, such as the algebraic decay of exit and recurrence distributions.},

	abstract = {Non-resonant divertors (NRDs) separate the confined plasma from the surrounding plasma facing components (PFCs). The resulting striking field line intersection pattern on these PFCs is insensitive to plasma equilibrium effects. However, a complex scrape-off layer (SOL), created by chaotic magnetic topology in the plasma edge, connects the core plasma to the PFCs through varying magnetic flux tubes. The Compact Toroidal Hybrid (CTH) serves as a test-bed to study this by scanning across its inductive current. Simulations observe a significant change of the chaotic edge structure and an effective distance between the confined plasma and the instrumented wall targets. The intersection pattern is observed to be a narrow helical band, which we claim is a resilient strike line pattern. However, signatures of finger-like structures, defined as heteroclinic tangles in chaotic domains, within the plasma edge connect the island chains to this resilient pattern. The dominant connection length field lines intersecting the targets are observed via heat flux modeling with EMC3-EIRENE. At low inductive current levels, the excursion of the field lines resembles a limited plasma wall scenario. At high currents, a private flux region is created in the area where the helical strike line pattern splits into two bands. These bands are divertor legs with distinct SOL parallel particle flow channels. The results demonstrate the NRD strike line pattern resiliency within CTH, but also show the underlying chaotic edge structure determining if the configuration is diverted or limited. This work supports future design efforts for a mechanical structure for the NRD.},

	abstract = {The TCV tokamak is augmenting its unique historical capabilities (strong shaping, strong electron heating) with ion heating, additional electron heating compatible with high densities, and variable divertor geometry, in a multifaceted upgrade program designed to broaden its operational range without sacrificing its fundamental flexibility. The TCV program is rooted in a three-pronged approach aimed at ITER support, explorations towards DEMO, and fundamental research. A 1 MW, tangential neutral beam injector (NBI) was recently installed and promptly extended the TCV parameter range, with record ion temperatures and toroidal rotation velocities and measurable neutral-beam current drive. ITER-relevant scenario development has received particular attention, with strategies aimed at maximizing performance through optimized discharge trajectories to avoid MHD instabilities, such as peeling-ballooning and neoclassical tearing modes. Experiments on exhaust physics have focused particularly on detachment, a necessary step to a DEMO reactor, in a comprehensive set of conventional and advanced divertor concepts. The specific theoretical prediction of an enhanced radiation region between the two X-points in the low-field-side snowflake-minus configuration was experimentally confirmed. Fundamental investigations of the power decay length in the scrape-off layer (SOL) are progressing rapidly, again in widely varying configurations and in both D and He plasmas; in particular, the double decay length in L-mode limited plasmas was found to be replaced by a single length at high SOL resistivity. Experiments on disruption mitigation by massive gas injection and electron-cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) have begun in earnest, in parallel with studies of runaway electron generation and control, in both stable and disruptive conditions; a quiescent runaway beam carrying the entire electrical current appears to develop in some cases. Developments in plasma control have benefited from progress in individual controller design and have evolved steadily towards controller integration, mostly within an environment supervised by a tokamak profile control simulator. TCV has demonstrated effective wall conditioning with ECRH in He in support of the preparations for JT-60SA operation.},

	title = {Turbulent ion heating in {TCV} tokamak plasmas},
	abstract = {The Tokamak à configuration variable (TCV) features the highest electron cyclotron wave power density available to resonantly heat (ECRH) the electrons and to drive noninductive currents in a fusion grade plasma (ECCD). In more than 15 years of exploitation, much effort has been expended on real and velocity space engineering of the plasma electron energy distribution function and thus making electron physics a major research contribution of TCV. When a plasma was first subjected to ECCD, a surprising energisation of the ions, perpendicular to the confining magnetic field, was observed on the charge exchange spectrum measured with the vertical neutral particle analyser (VNPA). It was soon concluded that the ion acceleration was not due to power equipartition between electrons and ions, which, due to the absence of direct ion heating on TCV, has thus far been considered as the only mechanism heating the ions. However, although observed for more than ten years, little attention was paid to this phenomenon, whose cause has remained unexplained to date. The key subject of this thesis is the experimental study of this anomalous ion acceleration, the characterisation in terms of relevant parameters and the presentation of a model simulation of the potential process responsible for the appearance of fast ions. The installation of a new compact neutral particle analyser (CNPA) with an extended high energy range (≤ 50 keV) greatly improved the fast ion properties diagnosis. The CNPA was commissioned and the information derived from its measurement (ion temperature and density, isotopic plasma composition) was validated against other ion diagnostics, namely the active carbon charge exchange recombination spectroscopy system (CXRS) and a neutron counter. In ohmic plasmas, where the ion heating agrees with classical theory, the radial ion temperature profile was successfully reconstructed by vertically displacing the plasma across the horizontal CNPA line of sight. Active charge exchange measurements, by doping the plasma with ion neutralisation targets injected with the diagnostic neutral beam (DNBI), were used to absolutely calibrate the NPA. Advanced modelling of the measured hydrogenic charge exchange spectra with the neutralisation and neutral transport codes KN1D and DOUBLE-TCV permitted a calculation of the absolute neutral density profiles of the plasma species. The energisation and the properties of fast ions were studied in dedicated, low density, cold ion, hot electron plasmas, resonantly heated at the second harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency. The ion acceleration occurs on a characteristic timescale in the sub-millisecond range and comprises up to 20 \% of the plasma ions. The number of fast ions nis and their effective temperature Tis are found to depend strongly on the bulk and suprathermal electron parameters, in particular Tis ≤ Teb (electron bulk) and nis ∼ Vde (toroidal electron drift speed). The suprathermal electrons, abundantly generated in plasmas subjected to ECCD, are diagnosed with perpendicular and oblique viewing electron cyclotron emission (ECE) antennas and the measured frequency spectra are reconstructed with the relativistic ECE radiation balance code NOTEC-TCV. With steady-state ECRH and ECCD, the fast ion population reaches an equilibrium state. The spatial fast ion temperature profile is broad, of similar shape compared to the bulk ion temperature profile. The hottest suprathermal temperature observed is Tis ≤ 6 keV. Various potential ion acceleration mechanisms were examined for relevance in the TCV parameter range. The simultaneous wave–electron and wave–ion resonances of ion acoustic turbulence (IAT) show the best correlation with the available experimental knowledge. Ion acoustic waves are emitted by the weakly relativistic circulating electrons and are mainly Landau damped onto the ions. Destabilisation of IAT is markedly facilitated by the important degree of nonisothermicity Te/Ti ≥ 40 of X2 EC heated TCV plasmas. Efforts were undertaken to consistently model the experimental observations using a numerical experiment. The relevant physics describing IAT was implemented in a finite difference code solving the quasilinear diffusion equation describing the time evolution of the electron and ion distribution functions. The simulations, fed as far as possible with experimentally available information, confirm the growth and saturation of IAT. Electrons and ions are initially preferentially heated in the toroidal direction. As the ions gain energy, the ion waves are damped more efficiently and only modes propagating at oblique angles can still grow, thus accelerating ions into the radial perpendicular direction. The simulation shows that turbulence reaches a steady-state when the ions are sufficiently hot to permanently stabilise IAT. The parameters describing the tail of the modelled equilibrium ion distribution agree quantitatively well with the CNPA measurement. Preliminary studies investigated on the interaction of fast ions with the sawtooth instability. It is found that the fast ion population in sawtoothing plasmas is transiently enforced with each sawtooth collapse. It is presently thought that the toroidal electric reconnection field lowers the IAT stability threshold thus producing more suprathermal ions},

	title = {Edge {Localized} {Mode} {Control} in {TCV}},
	abstract = {The Tokamak concept, based on magnetic confinement of a hydrogen plasma, is one of today's most promising paths to energy production by nuclear fusion. The experimental scenarios leading to the largest fusion rate are based on a high confinement plasma regime, the H-mode, in which the energy and particle confinement are enhanced by a transport barrier located at the plasma edge and forming a pedestal in the plasma pressure profile. In standard axisymmetric magnetic configurations, stationary H-mode regimes suffer from instabilities of the plasma edge, the so-called edge localized modes (ELMs), leading to potentially damaging repetitive ejections of heat and particles toward the plasma facing components. In ITER, a Tokamak currently being built to demonstrate net power production from fusion, type I ELMs are expected to occur during high performance discharges. It is expected that the power flux released by these ELMs will cause an intolerable erosion and heat load on the plasma facing components. The control of ELMs, in terms of frequency and energy loss, is therefore of primary importance in the field of magnetic fusion and is subject to an intense research effort worldwide. This thesis, in line with this effort, focuses on two particular ELM control methods: local continuous or modulated heating of the plasma edge, and application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). In this thesis, the effects of plasma edge heating on the ELM cycle have been investigated by applying electron cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) to the edge of an H-mode plasma featuring type I ELMs in the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV). As the power deposition location is shifted gradually toward the plasma pressure pedestal, an increase of the ELM frequency by a factor 2 and a decrease of the energy loss per ELM by the same factor are observed, even though the power absorption efficiency is reduced. This unexpected and, as yet, unexplained phenomenon, observed for the first time, runs contrary to the intrinsic type I ELM power dependence and provides a new approach for ELM mitigation. The effects of heating power modulation on the ELM cycle have also been experimentally investigated. It showed that power modulation synchronized in real-time with the ELM cycle is able to pace the ELMs with low deviation from a given frequency. Experimental results also clearly indicate that the ELM frequency purely remains a function of the heating power averaged over the ELM cycle, so that power modulation itself is not able to drive the ELM frequency and only has a stabilization effect. These results are in qualitative agreement with a simple 0D finite confinement time integrator model of the ELM cycle. RMP consists in applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plasma magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium flux surfaces with a spatial variation tuned to align with the equilibrium magnetic field lines. If each coil of an RMP coil system (i.e. a set of toroidally and poloidally distributed coils) is powered with an independent power supply, the coil current distribution can be tuned to optimize the RMP space spectrum. In the course of this thesis, a multi-mode Lagrange method, with no assumption on the coil geometry or spatial distribution, has been developed to determine this optimum, in the limit of the vacuum magnetic field approximation. This method appears to be an efficient way to minimize the parasitic spatial modes of the magnetic perturbation, and the coil current requirements, while imposing the amplitude and phase of a set of target modes. A figure of merit measuring the quality of a perturbation spectrum with respect to RMP independently of the considered coil system or plasma equilibrium is also proposed. To facilitate the application of the Lagrange method, a spectral characterization of the coil system, based on a generalized discrete Fourier transform applied in current space, is performed to determine how spectral degeneracy and side-bands creation limit the number of simultaneously controllable target modes. Finally, this thesis sets the foundations of experimental research in the particular subject of RMP at CRPP by proposing a physics-based design for a multi-purpose saddle coil system (SCS) for TCV, a coil system located and powered such as to create a helical magnetic perturbation. Using independent power supplies, the toroidal periodicity of this perturbation is tunable, allowing simultaneously ELM control, error field correction and vertical control. Other experimental applications, like resistive wall mode and rotation control, are also in view. In this thesis, the adequacy of two SCS designs, an in-vessel one and an ex-vessel one, is assessed with respect to the desired experimental applications. The current requirements and the system performances are also characterized. The conducting vessel wall is accounted for in a model used to determine the coupled response functions of the SCS, the screening of the magnetic perturbation by the wall, the induced voltages and currents during a plasma disruption and the maximal magnetic forces exerted on the SCS. A scaling of the SCS parameters with the number of coil turns is presented and the issue of coil heating and cooling is discussed},

	abstract = {The tokamak à configuration variable (TCV) is unique in its ability to create a variety of plasma shapes and to heat the electron population in high density regimes using microwave power at the third harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency. In the frame of this thesis, the impact of plasma shaping and heating on the properties of the edge transport barrier (ETB) in the high confinement mode (H-mode) was studied. This mode of operation is foreseen as one of the reference scenarios for ITER, the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor, which is being built to demonstrate the feasibility of thermonuclear fusion using magnetic confinement. A feature of H-mode regime operation are edge localized modes (ELMs), instabilities driven by the steep pressure gradients that form in the plasma edge region due to a transport barrier. During an ELM event, energy and particles are expelled from the plasma in a short burst. This will cause serious problems with respect to the heat load on plasma facing components in a tokamak of the size of ITER. Understanding of the phenomena associated with ELMs is thus required and dedicated investigations of their theory and experimental observations are carried out in many laboratories worldwide. This thesis presents several experimental and numerical investigations of tokamak behavior for configurations where the plasma edge plays an important role. From the experimental viewpoint, studies of transport barriers are challenging, as plasma parameters change strongly within a narrow spatial region. As part of the work presented here, the TCV Thomson scattering system was upgraded to meet the requirements for diagnosing electron temperature and density with high spatial resolution in the region of internal and external transport barriers. Simultaneously, the data analysis was significantly improved to cope with statistical uncertainties and alleviate eventual systematic errors. For measurements of the time evolution of density and temperature profile during the ELM cycle, the low repetition rate of the lasers used for Thomson scattering is a limiting. Although the system on TCV comprises 3 laser units that may be triggered in sequence with time separations down to 1 ms, time evolution over longer periods can only be reconstructed from repetitive events. In this context, an adjustment of the laser trigger to improve the synchronization with the ELM event is an advantage. A method was developed and implemented to generate a synchronizing trigger sequence, by a real-time monitoring of the D-alpha emission, which provides a marker for the ELM event. Recently, a "snowflake" (SF) divertor configuration, proposed as a possible solution to reduce the plasma-wall interaction by changing the divertor's poloidal magnetic field topology, was generated, for the first time, in TCV. A numerical code (KINX), based on a magnetohydrodynamic model (ideal MHD), was used to investigate the stability limits of this configuration under H-mode conditions and compare them with a similar standard single-null equilibrium. In a series of experiments, improved energy confinement was found and explained by improved stability of the edge region in the SF configuration. The influence of the pedestal structure in ELMy H-mode plasmas on the energy confinement and on ELM energy losses was investigated. The different ELM regimes found in TCV were analyzed, in particular the transition between type-III to type-I ELMs. The operational boundary of each ELM regime was characterized and verified by ideal MHD stability simulations for the ETB region. Recent studies on the scaling of the pedestal width with normalized poloidal pressure were confirmed. Using the capabilities of TCV, the influence of plasma shaping on pedestal parameters and MHD stability limits was investigated. In the past, models were developed to describe the onset of type-I ELMs, which are associated with modes in the ETB region arising from a coupling of pressure- and current-driven instabilities (coupled kink-ballooning modes). Experimental studies were performed to trace the temporal evolution of pedestal parameters characterizing the ETB during an ELM cycle. The results of these experiments were analyzed using information from MHD stability calculations. It is concluded that these models are capable of predicting limits as necessary conditions for ELM activity, but are not sufficient to fully explain ELM triggering},

	abstract = {Energy is essential for human existence and our future depends on plentiful and accessible sources of energy. The world population is fast growing and the average energy used per capita increases. One of the greatest challenges for human beings is that of meeting the growing demand for energy in a responsible, equitable and sustainable way. The possibility to obtain energy by "fusing" light atoms addresses these needs. Nuclear fusion reactions are clean, safe and the amount of fuel present on Earth (hydrogen isotopes) is practically inexhaustible and well distributed. Nuclear fusion is a natural process that occurs in all active stars like our Sun. Since the first demonstration of a deuterium fusion reaction (Rutherford 1933), researchers worldwide have tried to replicate this process on Earth by building a thermonuclear fusion reactor. Nevertheless, the challenge posed by the construction of a nuclear fusion reactor is greater than the one presented earlier by the development of a fission reactor. During the IAEA Conference in Geneva in the early 1958, L.A.Artsimovich declared: "Plasma physics is very difficult. Worldwide collaboration is needed for progress" and E.Teller, at the same conference: "Fusion technology is very complex. It is almost impossible to build a fusion reactor in this century". They were right. The extremely high temperature and density necessary to fuse hydrogen isotopes makes it difficult indeed to create a successful fusion reactor. Even though the physics of the fusion reaction appears clear, we are still facing problems on the road towards bulding the "box" that can efficiently confine the hot gas in the state of plasma. The best results so far have been obtained confining a plasma with strong magnetic fields in a toroidal configuration ("tokamak"). The Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas in Switzerland actively studies this promising configuration towards the development of a nuclear fusion reactor. The experimental activity of the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) mainly focuses on the research of optimized plasma shapes capable of improving the global performance and solve the technological challenges of a tokamak reactor. Several theoretical and experimental results show the importance of the plasma shape in tokamaks. The maximum value of β (an indicator of the confinement efficiency) is for example related to the ratio between the height and the width of the plasma. The plasma shape can also affect the power necessary to access improved confinement regimes, as well as the plasma stability. This thesis reports on a contribution towards the optimization of the tokamak plasma shape. In particular, it describes the theoretical and experimental studies carried out in the TCV tokamak on two innovative plasma shapes: the doublet shaped plasma and the snowflake divertor. Doublet shaped plasmas have been studied in the past by the General Atomics group. Since then, the development of new plasma diagnostics and the discovery of new confinement regimes have given new reasons for interest in this unusual configuration. TCV is the only tokamak worldwide theoretically able to establish and control this configuration. This thesis illustrates new motivations for creating doublet plasmas. The vertical stability of the configuration is studied using a rigid model and the results are compared with those obtained with the KINX MHD stability code. The best strategy for controlling a doublet on TCV is also investigated, and a possible setup of the TCV control system is suggested for the doublet configuration. Analyzing the possible scenarios for doublet creation, the most promising scenario consists of the creation of two independent plasmas, which are subsequently merged to establish a doublet. For this reason, particular attention needs to be devoted to the problem of the plasma start-up. In this thesis, a general analysis of the TCV ohmic and assisted with ECH plasma start-up is presented, and recent attempts to create a doublet plasma are reported. Since the magnetic field reconstruction at the breakdown time is important to better diagnose these plasmas, the entire magnetic system of TCV has been calibrated with an original technique, also described in the manuscript. The last part of this thesis is devoted to the snowflake divertor configuration. This innovative plasma shape has been proposed and theoretically studied by Dr. D.D.Ryutov from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In Ryutov's articles, this configuration was proposed to alleviate the problems of the plasma-wall interaction and possibly affect the plasma edge stability. The TCV tokamak was the first to report the creation and control of a snowflake configuration, and the candidate was the principal investigator of this work. These results are accordingly discussed in this thesis. Details are provided in particular on the strategy used to establish the configuration. An edge-localized mode (ELM) H-mode regime, supported by electron cyclotron heating, has been successfully established in a snowflake. This regime exhibits 2 to 3 times lower ELM frequency but only a 20\%-30\% increase in normalized ELM energy (ΔWELM/WP ) compared to an identically-shaped, conventional, single-null, diverted H-mode. Enhanced stability of mid- to high-toroidal-mode-number ideal modes is consistent with the different snowflake ELM phenomenology. Finally, the capability of the snowflake to redistribute the edge power on the additional strike points has been confirmed experimentally and is also reported in this thesis},

	title = {High {Density} {Plasma} {Heating} in the {Tokamak} à {Configuration} {Variable}},
	abstract = {The Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) is a medium size magnetic confinement thermonuclear fusion experiment designed for the study of the plasma performances as a function of its shape. It is equipped with a high power and highly flexible electron cyclotron heating (ECH) and current drive (ECCD) system. Up to 3 MW of 2nd harmonic EC power in ordinary (O2) or extraordinary (X2) polarization can be injected from TCV low-field side via six independently steerable launchers. In addition, up to 1:5 MW of 3rd harmonic EC power (X3) can be launched along the EC resonance from the top of TCV vacuum vessel. At high density, standard ECH and ECCD are prevented by the appearance of a cutoff layer screening the access to the EC resonance at the plasma center. As a consequence, less than 50\% of TCV density operational domain is accessible to X2 and X3 ECH. The electron Bernstein waves (EBW) have been proposed to overcome this limitation. EBW is an electrostatic mode propagating beyond the plasma cutoff without upper density limit. Since it cannot propagate in vacuum, it has to be excited by mode conversion of EC waves in the plasma. Efficient electron Bernstein waves heating (EBH) and current drive (EBCD) were previously performed in several fusion devices, in particular in the W7-AS stellarator and in the MAST spherical tokamak. In TCV, the conditions for an efficient O-X-B mode conversion (i.e. a steep density gradient at the O2 plasma cutoff) are met at the edge of high confinement (H-mode) plasmas characterized by the appearance of a pedestal in the electron temperature and density profiles. TCV experiments have demonstrated the first EBW coupling to overdense plasmas in a medium aspect-ratio tokamak via O-X-B mode conversion. This thesis work focuses on several aspects of ECH and EBH in low and high density plasmas. Firstly, the experimental optimum angle for the O-X-B mode conversion is successfully compared to the full-wave mode conversion calculation of the AMR code. The implementation of TCV ECH system geometry in AMR and the coupling of AMR to the LUKE quasi-linear Fokker-Planck solver for the TCV environment were part of this work. The power deposition location of modulated EBH is then detected inside the O2 plasma cutoff by oscillation analysis of the soft X-ray emission profile using the break-in-slope (BIS) analysis and a harmonic response identification method (HRIM), which is the demonstration of resonant EBH in TCV. The BIS and HRIM methods are also used to successfully detect and track the time-varying deposition locations of one and then two X2 power beams simultaneously. All experimental results are in good agreement within 10\% of the normalized plasma radius with numerical results of the AMR and C3PO ray-tracing codes coupled to LUKE. The global power absorption coefficient of modulated ECH (MECH) is studied by HRIM analysis of the plasma toroidal flux response measured by TCV diamagnetic loop (DML). Analysis of earlier X3 MECH and new X2 MECH experiments reveals a major perturbation of the method by the sawtooth magnetohydrodynamic activity in the plasma center. Indeed, an asymmetric improvement of the X3 power absorption (up to 100\%) with respect to the sign of the X2 ECCD pre-heating was observed in previous TCV experiments and remained unexplained by Fokker-Planck simulations until now. The present work allows to attribute this asymmetry to a sawtooth activity strongly destabilized by the central X2 co-ECCD locking to the X3 power modulation. The performances of EBW current drive (EBCD) in TCV are studied with the AMR-LUKE codes for several poloidal positions of the EBW injection. The maximum EBCD efficiency is obtained when the EBW are injected close the plasma midplane such that the wave parallel refractive index upshift is moderate and the absorption takes place at the plasma center where the electron temperature is the highest. However, the absolute driven current remains small (i.e. \&\#8818;1\% of the Ohmic current). Finally, a new loop-antenna for the detection of the lower-hybrid (LH) waves generated by a parametric instability (PI) at the X-B mode conversion was designed, built and installed in TCV torus. Fast monitoring of the LHPI spectrum allows to show for the first time the correlation of the amplitude of the detected waves with the local LHPI threshold power at the mode conversion region, estimated from the experimental profiles data. In an EBW power scan, the LHPI threshold power is estimated to be \&\#8818;50 kW in good agreement with the value predicted from the experimental profiles data. The LHPI energy cascade from the low to the high LH frequency bands with increasing EBH power is shown for the first time in TCV},

This model recognizes the input signal patterns and overcomes the problems of existing detection algorithms, such as the prominence algorithm and those of differential methods with high sensitivity for the threshold and signal intensity. To train the model, 10 sets of discharge radiation data from the KSTAR are used and sliced into 11091 inputs of length 12 ms, of which 20\% are used for validation. According to the receiver operating characteristic curves, our model shows a positive prediction rate and a true prediction rate of approximately 90\% each, which is comparable to the best detection performance afforded by other algorithms using their optimized hyperparameters. The accurate and automatic ELM-burst detection methodology used in our model can be beneficial for determining plasma properties, such as the ELM frequency from big data measured in multiple experiments using machines from the KSTAR device and ITER. Additionally, it is applicable to feature detection in the time-series data of other engineering fields.},

Small normalized ELM energy loss less than 1\% has been achieved in the grassy ELM regime in non-rotating plasmas. The highest pedestal pressure has been achieved with smaller edge toroidal rotation counter to the plasma current in the QH-mode. ELM control/suppression by pellet pacing and external magnetic field perturbation has been demonstrated, and so that a design activity of ELM control coils for ITER has started. Various effects of the edge toroidal rotation upon ELM characteristics have been found such as ELM energy loss (ELM frequency) in the type I ELM regime and the grassy ELM regime, changes in edge harmonic oscillation and achievable pedestal pressure in the QH-mode regime, and a screening effect in evaluation of island formation by ELM control coils.},

First, the technical aspects are introduced, including a description of the data selection, the datasets, the diagnostics used, the experimental and theoretical methods implemented and the main definitions. Second, the JET-ILW pedestal structure and stability are described. In particular, the work describes the links between the engineering parameters (power, gas and divertor configuration) and the disagreement with the peeling-ballooning (PB) model implemented with ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. Specifically, the work clarifies why the JET-ILW pedestal tends to be far from the PB boundary at high gas and high power, showing that a universal threshold in power and gas cannot be found but that the relative shift (the distance between the position of the pedestal density and of the pedestal temperature) plays a key role. These links are then used to achieve an empirical explanation of the behavior of the JET-ILW pedestal pressure with gas, power and divertor configuration. Third, the pedestal database is used to revise the scaling law of the pedestal stored energy. The work shows a reasonable agreement with the earlier Cordey scaling in terms of plasma current and triangularity dependence, but highlights some differences in terms of power and isotope mass dependence.},

One such scenario can be found at high densities, in highly shaped, close to double-null plasmas in ASDEX Upgrade, showing small ELMs characterized by a frequency Hz and a low power loss. Changing from gas fuelling to pellet fuelling results in edge profiles in which the collisionality of pedestal top and separatrix are decoupled. While the pedestal top values remain unchanged, only the phases with low separatrix and scrape-off layer (SOL) density show large ELMs with small ELMs in between. In phases with high separatrix density the small ELMs increase in amplitude and large ELMs do not occur. Similarly, a change in vertical plasma position by only ∼2 cm downwards, at constant reduces the size of small ELMs while the large ELMs appear more intense. A possible explanation of this behaviour could be the influence of the drive and the stabilization of modes positioned close to the separatrix. When these small ELM modes cause enough transport, they flatten the gradient region around the separatrix and thereby consequently narrow the effective pedestal width. Because a narrower pedestal is more stable against global PB modes, the stability boundary is shifted towards higher pressure gradients and type-I ELMs do not occur. It is shown that a higher increases the amplitude of small ELMs and, in agreement with basic ballooning mode theory, a higher local magnetic shear reduces their amplitude.},

	abstract = {One of our grand challenges towards fusion energy is the achievement of a high-performance plasma core coupled to a boundary solution. The high confinement mode (H-mode) provides such a high-performance fusion core due to the build-up of an edge transport barrier leading to a pedestal. However, it usually features type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) which pose a threat for long-duration plasma operation in future fusion devices as they induce large energy fluences onto the plasma facing components and typically are projected to damage the first wall. For future fusion devices, the integration of a stationary no-ELM regime with a power exhaust solution is indispensable. Several no-ELM and small-ELM regimes have extended their operational space in the past years, with the ultimate goal of providing an alternative core–edge solution to ITER and EU-DEMO. Prominent no-ELM or small-ELM alternatives include the I-mode, QH-mode, EDA H-mode, quasi-continuous exhaust (QCE) and ‘grassy’ ELM regimes, X-point radiator scenarios and negative triangularity L-mode. The state-of-the-art, including access conditions and main signatures, of these alternative regimes is reviewed. Many of these regimes partly match the operational space of ITER and EU-DEMO, however, knowledge gaps remain. Besides compatibility with divertor detachment and a radiative mantle, these include extrapolations to high Q operations, low core collisionality, high Greenwald fractions, impurity transport, amongst others. The knowledge gaps and possible strategies to close these gaps to show their applicability to ITER and EU-DEMO are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews current understanding of key physics elements that control the H-mode pedestal structure, which exists at the boundary of magnetically confined plasmas. The structure of interest is the width, height and gradient of temperature, density and pressure profiles in the pedestal. Emphasis is placed on understanding obtained from combined experimental, theoretical and simulation work and on results observed on multiple machines. Pedestal profiles are determined by the self-consistent interaction of sources, transport and magnetohydrodynamic limits. The heat source is primarily from heat deposited in the core and flowing to the pedestal. This source is computed from modeling of experimental data and is generally well understood. Neutrals at the periphery of the plasma provide the dominant particle source in current machines. This source has a complex spatial structure, is very difficult to measure and is poorly understood. For typical H-mode operation, the achievable pedestal pressure is limited by repetitive, transient magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. First principles models of peeling–ballooning modes are generally able to explain the observed limits. In some regimes, instability occurs below the predicted limits and these remain unexplained. Several mechanisms have been identified as plausible sources of heat transport. These include neoclassical processes for ion heat transport and several turbulent processes, driven by the steep pedestal gradients, as sources of electron and ion heat transport. Reduced models have successfully predicted the pedestal or density at the pedestal top. Firming up understanding of heat and particle transport remains a primary challenge for developing more complete predictive pedestal models.},

	abstract = {Precipitation is considered a crucial component in the hydrological cycle and changes in its spatial pattern directly influence the water resources. We compare different interpolation techniques in predicting the spatial distribution pattern of precipitation in Chongqing. Six interpolation methods, i.e., Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Diffusion Interpolation with Barrier (DIB), Kernel Interpolation with Barrier (KIB), Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK), were applied to estimate different rainfall patterns. Annual mean, rainy season and dry-season precipitation was calculated from the daily precipitation time series of 34 meteorological stations with a time span of 1991 to 2019, based on Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE) as validation indexes of the applied models for calculating the error degree and accuracy. Correlation test and Spearman coefficient was performed on the estimated and observed values. A method combining Entropy Weight and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Entropy-Weighted TOPSIS) was introduced to rank the performance of six interpolation methods. The results indicate that interpolation technique performs better in estimating during periods of low precipitation (i.e., dry season, relative to rainy season and mean annual). The performance priorities of the six methods under the combined multiple precipitation distribution patterns are KIB {\textgreater} EBK {\textgreater} OK {\textgreater} RBF {\textgreater} DIB {\textgreater} IDW. Among them, KIB method has the highest accuracy which maps more accurate precipitation surfaces, with the disadvantage that estimation error is prone to outliers. EBK method is the second highest, and IDW method has the lowest accuracy with a high degree of error. This paper provides information for the application of interpolation methods in estimating rainfall spatial pattern and for water resource management of concerned regions.},

	abstract = {Precipitation has a strong and constant impact on different economic sectors, environment and social activities all over the world. An increasing interest for monitoring and estimating the precipitation characteristics can be claimed in the last decades. However, in some areas, the ground-based network is still sparse and the spatial data coverage insufficiently addresses the needs. In the last decades, different interpolation methods provide an efficient response for describing the spatial distribution of precipitation. In this study, we compare the performance of seven interpolation methods used for retrieving the mean annual precipitation over the mainland Portugal, as follows: local polynomial interpolation (LPI), global polynomial interpolation (GPI), radial basis function (RBF), inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary cokriging (OCK), universal cokriging (UCK) and empirical Bayesian kriging regression (EBKR). We generate the mean annual precipitation distribution using data from 128 rain gauge stations covering the period 1991 to 2000. The interpolation results were evaluated using cross-validation techniques and the performance of each method was evaluated using mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) and Taylor diagram. The results indicate that EBKR performs the best spatial distribution. In order to determine the accuracy of spatial distribution generated by the spatial interpolation methods, we calculate the prediction standard error (PSE). The PSE result of EBKR prediction over mainland Portugal increases from south to north.},

	abstract = {Rainfall data in continuous space provide an essential input for most hydrological and water resources planning studies. Spatial distribution of rainfall is usually estimated using ground-based point rainfall data from sparsely positioned rain-gauge stations in a rain-gauge network. Kriging has become a widely used interpolation method to estimate the spatial distribution of climate variables including rainfall. The objective of this study is to evaluate three geostatistical (ordinary kriging [OK], ordinary cokriging [OCK], kriging with an external drift [KED]), and two deterministic (inverse distance weighting, radial basis function) interpolation methods for enhanced spatial interpolation of monthly rainfall in the Middle Yarra River catchment and the Ovens River catchment in Victoria, Australia. Historical rainfall records from existing rain-gauge stations of the catchments during 1980–2012 period are used for the analysis. A digital elevation model of each catchment is used as the supplementary information in addition to rainfall for the OCK and kriging with an external drift methods. The prediction performance of the adopted interpolation methods is assessed through cross-validation. Results indicate that the geostatistical methods outperform the deterministic methods for spatial interpolation of rainfall. Results also indicate that among the geostatistical methods, the OCK method is found to be the best interpolator for estimating spatial rainfall distribution in both the catchments with the lowest prediction error between the observed and estimated monthly rainfall. Thus, this study demonstrates that the use of elevation as an auxiliary variable in addition to rainfall data in the geostatistical framework can significantly enhance the estimation of rainfall over a catchment.},

	abstract = {Our modern society requires environmentally friendly solutions for energy production. Energy can be released not only from the fission of heavy nuclei but also from the fusion of light nuclei. Nuclear fusion is an important option for a clean and safe solution for our long-term energy needs. The extremely high temperatures required for the fusion reaction are routinely realized in several magnetic-fusion machines. Since the early 1990s, up to 16 MW of fusion power has been released in pulses of a few seconds, corresponding to a power multiplication close to break-even. Our understanding of the very complex behaviour of a magnetized plasma at temperatures between 150 and 200 million °C surrounded by cold walls has also advanced substantially. This steady progress has resulted in the construction of ITER, a fusion device with a planned fusion power output of 500 MW in pulses of 400 s. ITER should provide answers to remaining important questions on the integration of physics and technology, through a full-size demonstration of a tenfold power multiplication, and on nuclear safety aspects. Here we review the basic physics underlying magnetic fusion: past achievements, present efforts and the prospects for future production of electrical energy. We also discuss questions related to the safety, waste management and decommissioning of a future fusion power plant.},

The most challenging aspect of the H-mode physics is the sudden disappearance of the edge turbulence whereas its driving forces—the gradients—increase. As the physics behind the H-mode is subtle many features are not yet clarified. There is, however, substantial experimental and theoretical evidence that turbulent flows, which normally limit the confinement, are diminished by sheared poloidal flow residing at the plasma edge. There are many conceivable mechanisms giving rise to sheared flow. The most intriguing of these is that fluctuations themselves induce the flow, which acts back to its generating origin and annihilates the turbulence. This review concentrates mostly on the transition physics, describes one line of understanding the H-mode in more detail, recalls some of the older observations and summarizes the achievements in the H-mode for both tokamaks and stellarators.},

	title = {{MHD} stability limits in the {TCV} tokamak},
	abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities can limit the performance and degrade the confinement of tokamak plasmas. The Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV), unique for its capability to produce a variety of poloidal plasma shapes, has been used to analyse various instabilities and compare their behaviour with theoretical predictions. These instabilities are perturbations of the magnetic field which usually extend to the plasma edge where they can be detected with magnetic pick-up coils as magnetic fluctuations. A spatially dense set of magnetic probes, installed inside the TCV vacuum vessel, allows for a fast observation of these fluctuations. The structure and temporal evolution of coherent modes is extracted using several numerical methods. In addition to the setup of the magnetic diagnostic and the implementation of analysis methods, the subject matter of this thesis focuses on four instabilities which impose local and global stability limits. Al1 of these instabilities are relevant for the operation of a fusion reactor and a profound understanding of their behaviour is required in order to optimise the performance of such a reactor. Sawteeth, which are central relaxation oscillations common to most standard tokamak scenarios, have a significant effect on central plasma parameters. In TCV, systematic scans of the plasma shape have revealed a strong dependence of their behaviour on elongation κ, and triangularity δ, with high κ and low δ leading to shorter sawteeth with smaller crashes. This shape dependence is increased by applying central electron cyclotron heating (ECH), which increases or decreases the sawtooth period, depending on the plasma shape. The response to additional heating power is determined by the role of ideal or resistive MHD in triggering the sawtooth crash. For plasma shapes where additional heating and consequently, a faster increase of the central pressure shortens the sawteeth, the low experimental limit of the pressure gradient within the q = 1 surface is consistent with ideal MHD predictions. The observed decrease of this limit with elongation is also in qualitative agreement with ideal MHD theory. Edge localised modes (ELMs), occurring in TCV Ohmic high-confinement mode discharges, were observed to be preceded by coherent magnetic oscillations. The precursors prior to small ELMs, believed to be of type III, and prior to larger ELMs, previously referred to as TCV large ELMs, show the same characteristics, which allows for an identification of both ELMs to be of type III according to the usual classification scheme. The detected poloidal and toroidal mode structures are consistent with a resonant flux surface close to the plasma edge. Unlike conventional MHD modes, these precursors start at a random toroidal location and then grow in amplitude and toroidal extent until they encompass the whole toroidal circumference. Thus, the asymmetry causing and maintaining the toroidal localisation of the ELM precursor, must be intrinsic to the plasma. Soft X-ray measurements show that the localised precursor always coincides with a central m = 1 mode, which can usually be associated with the sawtooth pre- or postcursor mode. A comparison of the phases indicates a correlation with the maximum of the central mode preceding the toroidal location of the ELM precursor and, therefore, a hitherto unobserved coupling between central modes and ELMs. Highly elongated plasmas promise several advantages, among them higher current and beta limits. During TCV experiments dedicated to an increasing of the plasma elongation, a new disruptive current limit, at values well below the conventional current limit corresponding to qa {\textgreater}2, was encountered for κ {\textgreater}2.3. This limit, which is preceded by a kink-type mode, is found to be consistent with ideal MHD stability calculations. The TCV observations, therefore, provide the first experimental confirmation of a deviation of the linear Troyon-scaling of the ideal beta limit with normalised current at high elongation, which was predicted over 10 years ago. In addition to the ideal beta limit, several other MHD events are observed in highly elongated plasmas. The axisymmetric mode causes vertical displacement events and thereby, imposes a lower current limit. This operational limit is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of the growth rate of the axisymmetric mode. Furthermore, minor disruption are occasionally observed. They are caused by bursts of tearing modes located close to the q = 1 surface, which are destabilised by flat central current profiles, typical for highly elongated plasmas. Neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs), which have been observed to limit the achievable beta in a number of tokamaks, arise from a helical perturbation of the bootstrap current caused by an existing seed island. Neoclassical m/n = 2/1 tearing modes have been identified in TCV discharges which are characterised by a low electron collisionality νe*, a medium ion collisionality ν*, a medium value of beta and strongly peaked pressure and current profiles. In contrast to other tokamak experiments, where sawteeth, fishbones or ELMs generate the seed island, the required seed island is provided by a conventional tearing mode. The island clearly shows a conventional and a neoclassical growth phase. The TCV results provide the first clear observations of such a trigger mechanism which could also explain the occurrence of "triggerless" NTMs observed in other experiments. The slowly growing seed island also allows a measurement of the critical seed island width ωcrit, which is observed to increase with increasing density. In conclusion, several local and a global stability limits are analysed. These instabilities can limit the pressure gradient and thereby, the performance of the plasma. The presented results reveal several previously unobserved features of commonly observed instabilities. Since the most of the new observations can be explained by theory, they improve the predictive capabilities with respect to new experiments. The experiments have also shown some new interactions among different instabilities, which add to the already crowded complexities of MHD phenomena in fusion plasmas},

	abstract = {A simple dynamic model of spatiotemporally propagating transport barriers and transition fronts from low (L) to high (H) confinement regimes is presented. The model introduces spatial coupling (via transport) into the coupled evolution equations for flow shear and fluctuation intensity, thus coupling the supercritical L to H bifurcation instability to turbulent transport. Hence, fast spatiotemporal front propagation and evolutionary behavior result. The theory yields expressions for the propagation velocity and termination point of an L–H transition front and transport barrier. When the evolution of the pressure gradient, ∇Pi, and the contribution of ∇Pi to sheared electric field, Er′, is included, the ambient pretransition pressure gradient acts as a local source term that drives the evolution of the poloidal velocity shear. The transition may then evolve either as a spatiotemporally propagating front or as a uniform (i.e., nonlocal) fluctuation reduction or quench. The precise route to transition adopted depends on the relative magnitudes of the front transit time, τT, and the fluctuation reduction time, τf, respectively.

	abstract = {The tokamak à configuration variable (TCV) is unique in its ability to create a variety of plasma shapes and to heat the electron population in high density regimes using microwave power at the third harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency. In the frame of this thesis, the impact of plasma shaping and heating on the properties of the edge transport barrier (ETB) in the high confinement mode (H-mode) was studied. This mode of operation is foreseen as one of the reference scenarios for ITER, the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor, which is being built to demonstrate the feasibility of thermonuclear fusion using magnetic confinement. A feature of H-mode regime operation are edge localized modes (ELMs), instabilities driven by the steep pressure gradients that form in the plasma edge region due to a transport barrier. During an ELM event, energy and particles are expelled from the plasma in a short burst. This will cause serious problems with respect to the heat load on plasma facing components in a tokamak of the size of ITER. Understanding of the phenomena associated with ELMs is thus required and dedicated investigations of their theory and experimental observations are carried out in many laboratories worldwide. This thesis presents several experimental and numerical investigations of tokamak behavior for configurations where the plasma edge plays an important role. From the experimental viewpoint, studies of transport barriers are challenging, as plasma parameters change strongly within a narrow spatial region. As part of the work presented here, the TCV Thomson scattering system was upgraded to meet the requirements for diagnosing electron temperature and density with high spatial resolution in the region of internal and external transport barriers. Simultaneously, the data analysis was significantly improved to cope with statistical uncertainties and alleviate eventual systematic errors. For measurements of the time evolution of density and temperature profile during the ELM cycle, the low repetition rate of the lasers used for Thomson scattering is a limiting. Although the system on TCV comprises 3 laser units that may be triggered in sequence with time separations down to 1 ms, time evolution over longer periods can only be reconstructed from repetitive events. In this context, an adjustment of the laser trigger to improve the synchronization with the ELM event is an advantage. A method was developed and implemented to generate a synchronizing trigger sequence, by a real-time monitoring of the D-alpha emission, which provides a marker for the ELM event. Recently, a "snowflake" (SF) divertor configuration, proposed as a possible solution to reduce the plasma-wall interaction by changing the divertor's poloidal magnetic field topology, was generated, for the first time, in TCV. A numerical code (KINX), based on a magnetohydrodynamic model (ideal MHD), was used to investigate the stability limits of this configuration under H-mode conditions and compare them with a similar standard single-null equilibrium. In a series of experiments, improved energy confinement was found and explained by improved stability of the edge region in the SF configuration. The influence of the pedestal structure in ELMy H-mode plasmas on the energy confinement and on ELM energy losses was investigated. The different ELM regimes found in TCV were analyzed, in particular the transition between type-III to type-I ELMs. The operational boundary of each ELM regime was characterized and verified by ideal MHD stability simulations for the ETB region. Recent studies on the scaling of the pedestal width with normalized poloidal pressure were confirmed. Using the capabilities of TCV, the influence of plasma shaping on pedestal parameters and MHD stability limits was investigated. In the past, models were developed to describe the onset of type-I ELMs, which are associated with modes in the ETB region arising from a coupling of pressure- and current-driven instabilities (coupled kink-ballooning modes). Experimental studies were performed to trace the temporal evolution of pedestal parameters characterizing the ETB during an ELM cycle. The results of these experiments were analyzed using information from MHD stability calculations. It is concluded that these models are capable of predicting limits as necessary conditions for ELM activity, but are not sufficient to fully explain ELM triggering},

The first model proposes a scaling of the pedestal width Δ/a ∝ ρ*1/2 to ρ* based on the radial extent of the pedestal being set by the point where the linear turbulence growth rate exceeds the E×B velocity. In the multidevice experiment where ρ* at the pedestal top was varied by a factor of four while other dimensionless parameters where kept fixed, it has been observed that the temperature pedestal width in real space coordinates scales with machine size, and that therefore the gyroradius scaling suggested by the model is not supported by the experiments. The density pedestal width is not invariant with ρ* which after comparison with a simple neutral fuelling model may be attributed to variations in the neutral fuelling patterns. The second model, EPED1, is based on kinetic ballooning modes setting the limit of the radial extent of the pedestal region and leads to Δψ ∝ βp1/2. All three devices show a scaling of the pedestal width in normalised poloidal flux as Δψ ∝ βp1/2, as described by the kinetic ballooning model; however, on JET and AUG, this could not be distinguished from an interpretation where the pedestal is fixed in real space. Pedestal data from all three devices have been compared with the predictive pedestal model EPED1 and the model produces pedestal height values that match the experimental data well.},

Patients with tinnitus often have poor quality of life, as well as severe anxiety and depression. New approaches to treat tinnitus are needed.
Objective
Evaluate the effects of non-invasive neuromodulation on tinnitus through a metaanalysis and modeling study. The main hypothesis was that real as compared to sham neuromodulation that decreases tinnitus will modulate regions in line with the neurobiological models of tinnitus.
Methods and results
The systematic review, conducted from Pubmed, Cochrane and PsycINFO databases, showed that active as compared to sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) reduced tinnitus, but active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation did not significantly differ. Further, rTMS over the auditory cortex was the most effective protocol. The modeling results indicate that this rTMS protocol elicited the strongest electric fields in the insula. Also, rTMS was particularly beneficial in women. Finally, the placebo effects were highly variable, highlighting the importance of conducting sham-controlled trials.
Conclusion
In sum, neuromodulation protocols that target the auditory cortex and the insula may hold clinical potential to treat tinnitus.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Tinnitus is the conscious perception of an auditory sensation in the absence of external stimulus. Proposed theories are based on neuroplastic changes that occur due to sensory deprivation. The authors review the relevant literature on functional imaging and neuromodulation of tinnitus and describe potential targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS).
Materials and Methods
A MEDLINE keyword and Medical Subject Heading term literature search was performed using PubMed for tinnitus, neuromodulation, DBS, transcranial magnetic stimulation, epidural electrode stimulation, intradural electrode stimulation, functional imaging, and connectivity. Data from these reports were extracted and reviewed.
Results
Multiple imaging studies are employed to understand the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Abnormal regions and altered connectivity implicated in tinnitus include auditory pathway and limbic structures. Neuromodulation attempts to correct this hyperexcitable state by disrupting these aberrant oscillations and returning activity to baseline. Applied treatment modalities include transcranial magnetic stimulation, epidural/intradural electrode stimulation, and DBS. More recently, modulation of autonomic pathways through vagus nerve stimulation and paired auditory sounds has demonstrated tinnitus improvement via plasticity changes.
Conclusions
DBS shows much promise as a therapeutic option for tinnitus. Stimulation of the auditory pathway, particularly the medial geniculate body, could counteract thalamocortical dysrhythmias and reduce gamma activity implicated in the tinnitus percept. Stimulation of the limbic pathway could decrease attention to and perception of tinnitus. Additional studies, focusing on the involvement of thalamic and limbic structures in the pathophysiology of tinnitus, are needed to support the use of DBS.},

	title = {Development of free-boundary equilibrium and transport solvers for simulation and real-time interpretation of tokamak experiments},
	abstract = {To exploit fusion as a source of energy, a hot and dense confined plasma is needed. This isachieved in tokamaks by actively controlling the plasma state meaning shape, position andinternal kinetic profiles. This thesis addresses two topics: the development of a tokamaksimulator to design and test real-time controllers; the reconstruction of the plasma state fromdiagnostic measurements.A flexible control oriented simulator is needed to design the feedforward trace of the currentevolution in the external conductors and to test/design and verify the controllers that maintainthe desired shape, position and vertical stability. A fullyMatlab-based suite of routines called"LIUQE-suite", sharing the same optimized low level routines, has been developed at SPCEPFLaddressing multiple problems related to the free-boundary equilibrium. It covers the fullrange of free-boundary magnetic equilibrium codes from computing the coil currents for asequence of desired plasma equilibria (FBT code), simulating the plasma magnetic evolutioncoupled to controller dynamics (FGE code), performing magnetic equilibrium reconstruction(MER) from synthetic/experimental data both in post discharge and for real-time analysis(LIUQE code).In this thesis, two new codes have been added to this code suite. FGS (Forward Grad-ShafranovStatic) which solves the forward static free-boundary equilibrium problem. FGE (ForwardGrad-Shafranov Evolutive) which solves the dynamics of conductor current evolution, coupledto the resistive plasma current decay on subsequent states of free-boundary equilibria. Bothcodes uses the newly implemented Jacobian Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method, which combinesthe stability property of the Newton-like algorithm without requiring to formexplicitlythe Jacobian of the problem. This enables the implementation of a monolithic approachand avoids iterative coupling between the free-boundary solution and 0D current diffusionequation (CDE). A particular form of the CDE, derived in this thesis, allows to avoid the expensivecomputation of the geometrical coefficients in the coupling. A linearized version ofFGE in state-space formis presented, consistently including deformable plasmas and currentdiffusion. A novel contribution of this thesis is also the derivation of an analytic Jacobian forthe free-boundary forward equilibriumproblem discretized in space with finite differences,which can enable the implementation of a standard Newton method. FGS was used to investigatethe impact of some simplification hypotheses in the LIUQE algorithm, related tothe functional dependencies of the synthetic diagnostics on the plasma flux map, finding a small impact to the resulting magnetic equilibrium reconstruction (MER), confirming therobustness of LIUQE code. A proof of principle application of Bayesian analysis to obtainuncertainty quantification for MER is shown. To validate the implementation of FGE, thegrowth rates of VDEs for several TCV plasmas were compared to the rigid displacement RZIPmodel. After coupling the real vertical stability and position controller of TCV, the request ofthe central solenoid in the simulation was compared to the experiment, in order to verify thecorrectness of the CDE implemented. Good agreement was found in all cases,allowing FGSand FGE to be used for the development of TCV controllers in future.Kinetic equilibrium reconstruction (KER) is the consistent reconstruction of the plasma fluxsurface shapes and int},

	abstract = {Equilibrium reconstruction consists in identifying, from experimental measurements, a distribution of the plasma current density that satisfies the pressure balance constraint. The LIUQE code adopts a computationally efficient method to solve this problem, based on an iterative solution of the Poisson equation coupled with a linear parametrisation of the plasma current density. This algorithm is unstable against vertical gross motion of the plasma column for elongated shapes and its application to highly shaped plasmas on TCV requires a particular treatment of this instability. TCV's continuous vacuum vessel has a low resistance designed to enhance passive stabilisation of the vertical position. The eddy currents in the vacuum vessel have a sizeable influence on the equilibrium reconstruction and must be taken into account. A real time version of LIUQE has been implemented on TCV's distributed digital control system with a cycle time shorter than 200μs for a full spatial grid of 28 by 65, using all 133 experimental measurements and including the flux surface average of quantities necessary for the real time solution of 1.5 D transport equations. This performance was achieved through a thoughtful choice of numerical methods and code optimisation techniques at every step of the algorithm, and was coded in Matlab and Simulink for the off-line and real time version respectively.},

	title = {Poloidal {CX} visible light plasma rotation diagnostics in {TCV}},
	abstract = {Controlled thermonuclear fusion is the main goal of plasma physics. At the Swiss Plasma Center, the Tokamak {\textbackslash}`a Configuration Variable (TCV) constitutes the main experiment on fusion research, where high temperature plasmas are confined by means of magnetic fields. The confinement of plasma energy and particles is limited by transport arising from the gradients between the hot-dense plasma core and the cold-rarefied plasma edge. Due to the tokamak topology, plasma can rotate in the toroidal and poloidal directions. Plasma rotation has a strong influence on confinement and stability, which makes its understanding a priority. There are many discrepancies between the theoretical rotation description and experiments, which stimulated research in the field. In this context this work provided experimental results of unprecedented accuracy, where plasma impurity parameters are measured with the charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic. CXRS exploits the CX signal induced by a diagnostic neutral beam injector (DNBI), permitting localised measurements of impurity rotation, density and temperature. During this work, the CXRS diagnostic was extended with the development of a new high resolution system, termed CXRS-EDGE, devoted to the study of edge profiles. The accuracy improvements with respect to the legacy systems were obtained through an high throughput lens spectrometer and numerical aperture matching optics, resulting in rotation uncertainties {\textless}1 km/s. The upgraded CXRS diagnostic was used in the study of the impact of the sawtooth (ST) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) instability on rotation in L-mode limited plasmas and on the changes in edge impurity parameters at the onset of the H-mode in diverted discharges. The evolution of impurity profiles during a canonical ST were studied with a 2 ms time resolution. Rotation profiles suddenly change at the ST crash, passing from peaking counter-current to hollow co-current in the core, showing evidence of a co-current torque at the crash of increasing magnitude with the ST period. This explains the Ip scaling observed in TCV L-mode plasmas. This effect must be included in realistic theoretical models and might be exploited in tailoring rotation using ST period and radius as actuators. The crash is also characterised by expulsion of impurity from the core, resulting in hollow post-crash profiles, that can be exploited in a reactor scenario for avoiding impurity accumulation and for ash removal. The first accurate measurement of the changes in impurity flow across the transition to ELM-free H-mode were performed in this work. A narrow and deep poloidal rotation well develops at the last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the transition, together with a density pedestal and an increase of the temperature. From the kinetic profiles the radial electric field was computed, revealing the development of the well characteristic of H-mode as observed in other devices. The evolution of its components suggests involvement of the poloidal rotation in the triggering of the transition. A reasonable agreement was found from the comparison of the impurity rotation with neoclassical predictions. The observations reported in this work constitute a strong constrain for theoretical models, demonstrate the strong influence that fast MHD events have on transport and set more stringent conditions for edge impurity behaviours},

	abstract = {Dealing with electromagnetic fields, in particular current and related magnetic fields, yields “natural” physical vector relations in 3-D. However, when it comes to choosing local coordinate systems, the “usual” right-handed systems are not necessarily the best choices, which means that there are several options being chosen. In the magnetic fusion community such a difficulty exists for the choices of the cylindrical and of the toroidal coordinate systems. In addition many codes depend on knowledge of an equilibrium. In particular, the Grad–Shafranov axisymmetric equilibrium solution for tokamak plasmas, ψ, does not depend on the sign of the plasma current Ip nor that of the magnetic field B0. This often results in ill-defined conventions. Moreover the sign, amplitude and offset of ψ are of less importance, since the free sources in the equation depend on the normalized radial coordinate. The signs of the free sources, dp/dψ and dF2/dψ (p being the pressure, ψ the poloidal magnetic flux and F=RBφ), must be consistent to generate the current density profile. For example, RF and CD calculations (Radio Frequency heating and Current Drive) require an exact sign convention in order to calculate a co- or counter-CD component. It is shown that there are over 16 different coordinate conventions. This paper proposes a unique identifier, the COCOS convention, to distinguish between the 16 most-commonly used options. Given the present worldwide efforts towards code integration, the proposed new index COCOS defining uniquely the COordinate COnventionS required as input by a given code or module is particularly useful. As codes use different conventions, it is useful to allow different sign conventions for equilibrium code input and output, equilibrium being at the core of any calculations in magnetic fusion. Additionally, given two different COCOS conventions, it becomes simple to transform between them. The relevant transformations are described in detail.},

Additionally, the critical temperature gradients for the onset of turbulence are observed to increase in the negative triangularity plasmas. An estimation of the correlation length of the fluctuating structure shows smaller structure size in the negative triangularity cases, which are known to be associated with improved confinement. Together, these observations suggest that changing triangularity from positive to negative strongly influences the nature of the turbulent fluctuations excited in the plasma.},

	title = {Flux-tube and global grid-based gyrokinetic simulations of plasma microturbulence and comparisons with experimental {TCV} measurements},
	abstract = {In magnetic fusion devices, the radial transport of heat and particle largely exceeds predictions based on collisional processes. This is widely understood as a consequence of small-scale turbulence which results from the nonlinear behaviour of so-called microinstabilities. The complexity of such nonlinear phenomena allows one to address microturbulence only with a numerical description, carried out here within the gyrokinetic framework. This reduced kinetic model describes the evolution of the particle distribution functions and of the self-consistently generated electromagnetic fields neglecting the fast gyromotion. In this work we applied the grid-based gyrokinetic code GENE, using both its local and global versions, to model some of the experimental observations made in the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) at the Swiss Plasma Center. All simulations are performed considering realistic magnetic geometries, in turn provided by the MHD equilibrium solver CHEASE. In order to verify the interface of GENE with CHEASE, a series of benchmarks have been developed and successfully carried out in the linear local limit. These tests have then been extended to the global version of the code and a good agreement found with results obtained with the gyrokinetic Particle In Cell code ORB5. A significant part of this work deals with the electron heat confinement improvement observed when the shape of the plasma is modified by changing the sign of the edge triangularity, from positive to negative. In the latter case, half the heating power is required to maintain the same electron profiles compared to the former, which was experimentally interpreted as a better confinement at all radial locations, even though triangularity has a finite radial penetration depth. A series of local runs were carried out to investigate the dependence of profile stiffness on shaping, failing at reproducing both the absolute level of transport as well as the ratio between the two shapes. Global gradient-driven simulations have then been performed, showing a very high sensitivity of the electron heat flux with respect to the density gradient. These runs, carried out neglecting carbon impurities, are compatible with the experiments when using parameters from an experimentally well diagnosed discharge. In this case, strong global effects which lower the heat flux compared to local runs are seen. Local and global simulations have then been performed looking at axisymmetric dynamics in the frequency range of the Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM). Experimentally, the GAM is almost always observed as a radially coherent mode, i.e. an oscillation at constant frequency over a main fraction of the plasma minor radius. The only exception is for very large values of the edge safety factor q, where the mode looses its coherence becoming dispersive. A density ramp-up was studied with local simulation, already obtaining a reasonable agreement with measurements of heat transport as well as GAM frequency and amplitude. The coherent GAM was then investigated with global runs. Simulations qualitatively agree with experiments and a good match is recovered with ORB5 results when the same physical model is used. Finally, the hypothesis of a coherent-dispersive GAM transition related to the safety factor profile is addressed. It is found that changing only q is not sufficient to induce a regime transition, which thus appears to be due to other parameters, including finite machine size effects},

	abstract = {Human-made adhesives lose their tack rapidly after first use, while animals such as geckos can reuse their adhesive feet for a lifetime. Nature's use of fibrillar structures as strong, renewable and self-cleaning adhesives has inspired the development of synthetic adhesives with similarly structured surfaces. More than a decade of research and engineering has culminated in ‘gecko tape’: a re-useable adhesive that has a structured surface similar to that of geckos and that outperforms the usual sticky tape. We report experiments that show that, despite its name, a commercial gecko tape shares few adhesive principles with its eponym. In particular, we find no evidence that the micrometric features that are present on the surface of the gecko tape play a role in its adhesive strength. In addition, we find that contrary to the gecko, the tape leaves behind a layer of adhesive after removal from the surface. The fact that the gecko tape outperforms a conventional adhesive tape is due to the fact that the softness of the backing of the gecko tape allows to create a much larger contact area for a given normal force. The conclusion is that surface features are not necessary to create a superb adhesive; tuning the backing layer elasticity may be enough.},

The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region ω=0.25(kBTℏ). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0×10−12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10−11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

CAST is able to follow the Sun during sunrise and sunset and therefore three X-ray detectors are mounted on both ends of the magnet waiting for a photon from axion-to-photon conversion due to Primakoff effect. During its first phase, which concluded in 2004, CAST has been looking for axions with masses up to 0.02eV. The second phase did already start and first data were taken in December 2005. CAST's second phase manages to reestablish the coherence needed to scan for axions with masses up to 0.83eV by using a buffer gas. This enables the experiment to look into the theoretical regions for axions.},

Such particles are expected to emerge abundantly from the hot interior of stars. To test this prediction, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) uses a 9 T refurbished Large Hadron Collider test magnet directed towards the Sun. In the strong magnetic field, solar axions can be converted to X-ray photons which can be recorded by X-ray detectors. In the 2013–2015 run, thanks to low-background detectors and a new X-ray telescope, the signal-to-noise ratio was increased by about a factor of three. Here, we report the best limit on the axion–photon coupling strength (0.66 × 10−10 GeV−1 at 95\% confidence level) set by CAST, which now reaches similar levels to the most restrictive astrophysical bounds.},

	abstract = {Timelapse video of the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) following the Sun in the morning and in the evening. CAST is an experiment to search for hypothetical particles called "axions". These have been proposed by some theoretical physicists to explain why there is a subtle difference between matter and antimatter in processes involving the weak force, but not the strong force. If axions exist, they could be found in the centre of the Sun and they could also make up invisible dark matter.

CAST is searching for these particles with a telescope designed to detect axions from the Sun. It uses an unexpected hybrid of equipment from particle physics and astronomy. The telescope is made from a prototype of a dipole magnet for the Large Hadron Collider, with its hollow beam pipes acting as viewing tubes. To allow the magnet to operate in a superconducting state, it is supplied with cryogenic infrastructure previously used by the Large Electron-Positron collider's DELPHI experiment. A focusing mirror system for X-rays (recovered from the German space programme), an X-ray detector at each end, and a moving platform add the final touches to turn the magnet into a telescope that tracks the Sun.

The idea is that the magnetic field acts as a catalyst to transform axions into X-rays, making them relatively easy to detect. The strength of the superconducting dipole magnet and its long length ensure the efficiency of the process. CAST brings together techniques from particle physics and astronomy, and benefits from CERN’s expertise in accelerators, X-ray detection, magnets and cryogenics.

READ MORE: Renowned Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli gave a ‘Music for Hope’ solo performance Sunday (April 12) at the Duomo, the historic cathedral of Milan, Italy.

“On the day in which we celebrate the trust in a life that triumphs, I’m honored and happy to answer ‘Sì’ (yes) to the invitation of the City and the Duomo of Milan,” Bocelli responded o social media.

The performance, streamed live globally, is intended as a message of love, healing and hope to Italy and the world.

"History teaches us that after this is over will come a spring brighter than any we remember. Then we will have an unmissable opportunity to start fresh with a new system of values,” Bocelli wrote on Instagram. “We will smile, then - soon - about this upset, we will remember and we will tell our children and grandchildren all about the time when the world warned us, stopped us, before it was too late.”

READ MORE: For the family of the retired diplomat, the terror struck as they tried desperately to get him past the entrance doors of a private hospital. For the New Delhi family, it came when they had to create a hospital room in their ground-floor apartment. For the son of an illiterate woman who raised her three children by scavenging human hair, it came as his mother waited days for an ICU bed, insisting she’d be fine. 

Three families in a nation of 1.3 billion. Seven cases of COVID-19 in a country facing an unparalleled surge, with more than 300,000 people testing positive every day. 

When the pandemic exploded here in early April, each of these families found themselves struggling to keep relatives alive as the medical system neared collapse and the government was left unprepared. 

Across India, families scour cities for coronavirus tests, medicine, ambulances, oxygen and hospital beds. When none of that works, some have to deal with loved ones zippered into body bags.

 “Over the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased thirteenfold and the number of affected countries has tripled,” he said. “In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher,” he said.

“In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher,” Tedros said. “We’re deeply concerned both by the alarming spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction.”

For these reasons, he said, the WHO determined that the disease outbreak should be called a pandemic.

Kanzlerin Angela Merkel hielt am Mittwoch eine ungewöhnlich energische Rede im Bundestag. "Bis Weihnachten sind es noch 14 Tage", mahnte Merkel. Die Leopoldina hätte geraten, bis zu dieser Zeit alle Kontakte zu reduzieren. Es tue ihr im Herzen leid, sagte Merkel, "aber wenn der Preis für Weihnachtsmärkte ist, dass wir am Tag 500 Tote in Deutschland haben, dann ist dieser Preis zu hoch."

Man solle darüber nachdenken, ob es nicht irgend möglich ist, die Schulferien zum 16. Dezember starten zu lassen. Merkel wird ungewohnt emotional : "Wenn das das letzte Weihnachten mit unseren Großeltern ist, dann werden wir es ihm Nachhinein bereuen, jetzt zu wenig getan zu haben."

	abstract = {1 430 397\&nbsp;vues • 25 févr. 2021 • The short film above allows you to experience the brutality of the pandemic from the perspective of nurses inside a Covid-19 intensive care unit.

Opinion Video producer Alexander Stockton spent several days reporting at the Valleywise Medical Center in Phoenix. Two I.C.U. nurses wore cameras to show what it’s like to care for the sickest Covid patients a year into the pandemic.

So many Americans have died in hospitals without family by their side, but they were not alone. Nurses brush patients’ teeth, change their catheters and hold their hands in their final moments.

In just a year, we’ve lost half a million Americans to Covid-19. Vaccinations may be offering some relief, but inside I.C.U.s, nurses continue to contend with the trauma and grief of America’s carousel of death.

	shorttitle = {Modélisation analogique des écoulements d'eau sous-glaciaire},
	abstract = {Les vallées tunnels sont les structures de drainage d'eau de fonte les plus imposantes de l'environnement sous-glaciaire. L'inaccessibilité des milieux sous-glaciaires actuels limitent nos connaissances des mécanismes impliqués dans leurs formations, des paramètres contrôlant leur morphologie et de leurs influences sur la dynamique glaciaire. Ce travail présente une nouvelle approche expérimentale visant à mieux contraindre la formation et le fonctionnement des systèmes de vallées tunnels. Cette approche repose sur le développement d'un nouveau dispositif expérimental simulant la circulation d'eau pressurisée au sein d'un substrat poreux et perméable sous une couverture visqueuse. Les résultats des expériences menées avec ce dispositif ont permis de déterminer des relations étroites entre les paramètres du substrat et les modalités de l'écoulement d'eau sur la formation et la morphologie des vallées tunnels. Les résultats issus des expériences démontrent que ce dispositif permet de recréer des systèmes de vallées tunnels. L'étude de ces vallées expérimentales suggèrent que la topographie du substrat et la production d'eau de fonte joue un rôle primordial sur la genèse des vallées tunnels et sur leurs morphologies. Deux morphotypes de vallées tunnels ont pu être identifiés avec des morphologies et des mécanismes de formation indépendants. L'analyse de la dynamique de la calotte sus-jacente a permis de mettre en évidence un lien étroit entre le développement des vallées tunnels et la dynamique des "ice streams". L'évolution de la capacité de drainage des vallées tunnels semble contrôler la dynamique glaciaire en régulant le flux de glace transitant dans les "ice streams".},

	abstract = {Almost all of the world’s glaciers in the tropical latitudes are located in the Central Andes (Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia). Due to their high altitude, to the high level of radiation and to the tropical climate dynamics, they all are particularly threatened by climate change, as a result of not only warming, but also of changing variability of precipitation. Many glaciers are of crucial importance for the livelihood of the local populations and even for three capitals, Lima (Peru), La Paz (Bolivia) and Quito (Ecuador), which depend on them for water and energy supplies. This paper shows that after a period of increased flow due to the glacier melt disequilibrium, the available water resource will decrease along with the rapid shrinking of the glaciers considered as water reservoirs. The case of the Cordillera Blanca (Peru) is analyzed more in detail with the mid-term (20 years) and long-term (1–2 centuries) impact of the glacier shrinking on the local water resources. Associated risks for the population and consequences for the human activities (tourism, hydropower, agriculture and stock-breeding, large-scale irrigation) are described at each stage of the mountain range.},

	abstract = {Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nm, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430–750 terahertz (THz).

The main source of light on Earth is the Sun. Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey.
The primary properties of visible light are intensity, propagation-direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization, while its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found always to move at this speed in a vacuum.In physics, the term 'light' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the electromagnetic waves is called a photon and represents the quanta of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location and this location is where the photon "arrives". This is what is called the wave function collapse. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the wave–particle duality. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.},

	abstract = {In thermodynamics, the triple point of a substance is the temperature and pressure at which the three phases (gas, liquid, and solid) of that substance coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is that temperature and pressure at which the sublimation curve, fusion curve and the vaporisation curve meet. For example, the triple point of mercury occurs at a temperature of −38.83440 °C (−37.90192 °F) and a pressure of 0.165 mPa.
In addition to the triple point for solid, liquid, and gas phases, a triple point may involve more than one solid phase, for substances with multiple polymorphs. Helium-4 is a special case that presents a triple point involving two different fluid phases (lambda point).The triple point of water was used to define the kelvin, the base unit of thermodynamic temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The value of the triple point of water was fixed by definition, rather than measured, but that changed with the 2019 redefinition of SI base units. The triple points of several substances are used to define points in the ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from the triple point of hydrogen (13.8033 K) to the triple point of water (273.16 K, 0.01 °C, or 32.018 °F).
The term "triple point" was coined in 1873 by James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin.},

The internal friction as a function of temperature revealed two distinct peaks for each glass tested. One peak occurred in the temperature range −55° to +50°F. and the other in the range 300° to 500°F. All the observed peaks were found to be best represented by an assumed Gaussian distribution of heats of activation with the high-temperature peaks exhibiting a much wider distribution than the low-temperature peaks. It was therefore concluded that none of the peaks was a manifestation of a single heat of activation. The temperatures at which all peaks occurred increased with increasing frequency. From this shift of “peak” temperatures with frequency, the most likely heats of activation associated with each peak were calculated. The temperature dependence of the dynamic shear modulus for each glass was used to calculate the “relaxation strength” of the relaxation process for each peak. An analysis of all these data strongly indicated that the high-temperature peaks as well as the low-temperature ones were related to cooperative action among sodium ions.},

	abstract = {Performance-based fire design for cold-formed steel systems is in its infancy. This paper brings together existing research on cold-formed steel materials, members, and assemblages at elevated temperatures; and complementary analysis and design methods necessary for the development of analysis-based design for cold-formed steel systems under fire. Cold-formed steel systems have become popular in building construction as both load-bearing and non-load-bearing elements, primarily due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and ease of construction. Consequently, design specifications, and structural analysis tools have rapidly evolved to facilitate engineering design of these complex thin-walled members. However, in fires the performance of cold-formed steel systems are assured by prescriptive detailing and standardized testing. Today, engineering knowledge is rapidly advancing, providing the opportunity to contemplate analysis-based design as an enabling tool for general performance-based fire engineering of cold-formed steel systems. The review provided here includes experimental results on mechanical and thermal properties of cold-formed steel and temperature dependent constitutive relations, subsystem testing and computational simulations, and analysis models and exploratory methods for fire design, i.e., the building blocks towards performance-based fire design for cold-formed steel systems.},

	abstract = {The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit of time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. At 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagating.
The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.
In colloquial speech speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: typically sound travels most slowly in gases, faster in liquids, and faster still in solids. For example, while as noted above sound travels at 343 m/s in air, it travels at 1,481 m/s in water (almost 4.3 times faster) and at 5,120 m/s in iron (almost 15 times faster). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (39,000 ft/s),— about 35 times its speed in air and about the fastest it can travel under normal conditions.
Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), and a different type of sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear modulus and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.
In fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's Mach number. Objects moving at speeds greater than Mach1 are said to be traveling at supersonic speeds.},

(Human infants can actually hear frequencies slightly higher than 20 kHz, but lose some high-frequency sensitivity as they mature; the upper limit in average adults is often closer to 15–17 kHz.) Not all mammalian species are sensitive to the same range of frequencies. Most small mammals are sensitive to very high frequencies, but not to low frequencies. For instance, some species of bats are sensitive to tones as high as 200 kHz, but their lower limit is around 20 kHz—the upper limit for young people with normal hearing. One reason for these differences is that small objects, including the auditory structures of these small mammals, are better resonators for high frequencies, whereas large objects are better for low frequencies (which also explains why the violin has a higher pitch than the cello).},

We also recorded a vocalization with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz. Such values are among the highest recorded for any terrestrial mammal, and a relatively extreme example of ultrasonic communication. For Philippine tarsiers, ultrasonic vocalizations might represent a private channel of communication that subverts detection by predators, prey and competitors, enhances energetic efficiency, or improves detection against low-frequency background noise.},

	abstract = {The 3D morphology of bone arises through adaptation to its required engineering performance. Genetically and adaptively bone travels along a complex spatio-temporal trajectory to acquire optimal architecture. On a cellular, micro-anatomical scale, what mechanisms coordinate the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to produce complex and efficient bone architectures? One mechanism is examined here - chaotic nonlinear pattern formation (NPF) - which underlies in a unifying way natural structures as disparate as trabecular bone, swarms of birds flying, island formation, fluid turbulence and others. At the heart of NPF is the fact that simple rules operating between interacting elements, and Turing-like interaction between global and local signals, lead to complex and structured patterns. The study of “group intelligence” exhibited by swarming birds or shoaling fish has led to an embodiment of NPF called “particle swarm optimization” (PSO). This theoretical model could be applicable to the behavior of osteoblasts osteoclasts and osteocytes, seeing them operating “socially” in response simultaneously to both global and local signals (endocrine, cytokine, mechanical) resulting in their clustered activity at formation and resorption sites. This represents problem-solving by social intelligence, and could potentially add further realism to in-silico simulation of bone modeling. What insights has NPF provided to bone biology? One example concerns the genetic disorder Juvenile Pagets Disease (JPD) or Idiopathic Hyperphosphatasia, where the anomalous parallel trabecular architecture characteristic of this pathology is consistent with an NPF paradigm by analogy with known experimental NPF systems. Here coupling or “feedback” between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is the critical element. This NPF paradigm implies a profound link between bone regulation and its architecture: in bone the architecture is the regulation. The former is the emergent consequence of the latter.},

Here we review the environmental context of megafaunal ecological engineering in the Arctic; explore the mechanisms through which it can help mitigate climate change; and estimate its potential—based on bison and horse, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of generating an ecosystem shift that is economically viable in terms of carbon benefits and of sufficient scale to play a significant role in global climate change mitigation. Assuming a megafaunal-driven ecosystem shift we find support for a megafauna-based arctic NCS yielding substantial income in carbon markets. However, scaling up such projects to have a significant effect on the global climate is challenging given the large number of animals required over a short period of time. A first-cut business plan is presented based on practical information—costs and infrastructure—from Pleistocene Park (northeastern Yakutia, Russia). A 10 yr experimental phase incorporating three separate introductions of herds of approximately 1000 individuals each is costed at US\$114 million, with potential returns of approximately 0.3–0.4\% yr−1 towards the end of the period, and greater than 1\% yr−1 after it. Institutional friction and the potential role of new technologies in the reintroductions are discussed.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that climate warming is causing shrub cover to increase at high latitudes. Increased shrub cover generally lowers surface albedo, which results in higher energy absorption and further warming. In parts of Fennoscandia, herbivory is known to control vegetation height and abundance, and thus preventing this positive feedback. Here, we combine ﬁeld measurements of albedo, herbivory and vegetation characteristics in four topographicallydeﬁned vegetation types of varying shrub height and abundance with land surface modeling (JULES) to investigate if reindeer grazing can inﬂuence the energy balance of an arctic tundra. We ﬁnd that when reindeer reduces shrub height and abundance, summer albedo increases in both Betula nana-dominated heath vegetation and Salix glauca-dominated willow depressions. Model results reveal associated lower net radiation, and latent and sensible heat ﬂuxes in heavily-grazed sites in all shrub-dominated vegetation types. Our results also suggest that the structural shift from graminoid to shrub tundra drives the difference in summer albedo, rather than shifts from dwarf-shrub to tall-shrub tundra. Reindeer has thus a potential cooling effect on climate by increasing summer albedo and decreasing net radiation, which highlights the importance of mammalian herbivores for the earth system beyond their local grazing impacts. However, the strong effects of reindeer on albedo are probably restricted to areas with high reindeer densities, since a dramatic vegetation change is essential. The importance of these processes across the whole range of reindeer densities found in the arctic tundra needs to be further evaluated.},

	abstract = {Rewilding falls within the general framework of restoration ecology, but differs from a traditional view of habitat restoration and species reintroduction. Four initial steps are required to instigate a rewilding project: identification of the issue of conservation concern; identification of the missing ecological processes; identification of the functional characteristics required; and selection and reintroduction of the most suitable species. One method of progressing rewilding to a mainstream management option is to test a priori hypotheses with quantifiable outcomes within rewilding projects. Scenario planning and the 'three horizons' analysis allow long-term rewilding projects to be considered in three phases: the current, functionally deficient ecosystem in need of restoration; a projected future scenario where the ecosystem is restored to a functional and self-sustaining state; a transition state between the first and third horizons. This chapter explores the proposed restoration of the Caledonian pine forest in the Scottish Highlands as an example.},
