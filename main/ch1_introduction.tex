While the Sun is essential to the Earth's energy supply, solar flares would tear away its atmosphere if there were no magnetosphere to act as a planetary shield. 
The magnetosphere is however not immutable, and substorms are disturbances that can cause the magnetic field in its tail, the region away from the Sun, to reconnect, creating a flow of plasma that returns to the Earth at the poles and can be seen in brightening of auroras. In fact, most of the known matter in the universe is in the plasma state, and its ionisation means that the charged particles follow the magnetic field, which is why the magnetosphere acts as a shield.

On Earth, a good understanding of the magnetic topology is essential to achieve a controlled fusion process in a reactor device. The electromagnetic fields determine to a great extent the evolution of the plasma, making it well or poorly confined. Although fusion can also be achieved by inertial confinement, which is currently the subject of research, it is not quite as mature as the magnetic confinement for fusion. Several different geometric designs have been explored, and the attempt to confine the plasma in a toroidal shape has proved most promising. A stability condition for good confinement is that the field must twist, causing the particles to move between low and high radii, effectively rotating around a particular field line called the magnetic axis. 

This twisting is at the root of a schism in the design of toroidal magnetic fusion devices, leading to the two well known : Stellarator and Tokamak concepts. Both involve a magnetic field that is simultaneously toroidal and poloidal, rotating around the torus and around the magnetic axis. The toroidal component of the magnetic field is generated by the use of coils. They differ in the way the poloidal field is produced: Tokamaks induce a current in the plasma, which then generates the poloidal component according to Ampere's law. Stellarators have coils formed directly into modular shapes, eliminating the need for a net current, but are much more difficult to engineer and construct.

Start-ups have begun to emerge in the industry~: Common Wealth Fusion (Tokamak), Renaissance Fusion (Stellarator), Type One Energy (Stellarator), to name a few. This is encouraging as competition within the industry might help explore and identify where the key failure points are. However, a number of challenges remain, including the design of the Plasma Facing Components (PCFs), in particular the design of a region that will bear most of the heat flux, the divertor. Under fusion-relevant conditions, it will be exposed ``to a heat load that is ten times higher than that of a spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere (10-20 MWm$^2$)'' \cite{iter_divertor_nodate}. This is where some of the start-ups may miss the boat and try to move a little too fast, possibly making self-serving promises. Nevertheless, the link between industry and academia should be strong to ensure that progress in both areas is shared. 

Many divertor concept are being investigated. In stellarator, a type of divertor exploits a resonance due to the winding of the field line to create magnetic islands at specific locations in the edge region, which direct the heat flux to certain spots in the plasma-facing components. \cite{feng_review_2022} reviews the divertor-relevant geometric parameters of the magnetic island divertor in the W7X stellarator.

Another type of divertor would be the non-resonant divertor (NRD). An NRD would be placed in trough regions : configuration-specific `toroidal ridges' where the field lines primarily escape \cite{bader_hsx_2017}. \cite{garcia_exploration_2023} study the edge structure for a possible NRD in the Compact Toroidal Hybrid device by looking at the connection length, the travelled distance before hitting a PFC numerically using the EMC3-EIRENE 3D code. They describe the striking patterns on a hypothetical divertor for different currents and at different divertor positions, and link it to chaos. They calculate the heat flux and Mach number and draw a parallel with the chaotic structure present in another type of divertor, the ergodic divertor. An NRD, unlike a resonant divertor, would not be subject to the position of a particular low order island which can be affected by the generated field/currents of the plasma motion itself. A NRD could therefore be a more robust design.

The stochasticity present in magnetically confined devices, described in great detail by \cite{abdullaev_magnetic_2014}, leads to a third type of divertor concept, the ergodic divertor. Originally used to correct inaccuracies in toroidal coils that cause a non-axisymmetric field in tokamaks, resonant magnetic perturbation coils can also introduce mixing in the field line at the edge. It has been found to be beneficial for mitigating ELMs, a type of instability inherent to the high confinement regime in which, for example, the future DEMO reactor is designed to operate. The RMP coils are discussed as a means of creating an ergodic region in the edge, controlling the heat and particle fluxes, and directing the particles towards the divertor plates. The ergodic divertors have been used and studied in the WEST (formerly Tore Supra) and TEXTOR tokamaks.

The study of the edge plasma region is then essential for the design of a reliable divertors. As \cite{imbert-gerard_introduction_2020} nicely points out, the complexity of describing the processes in a plasma can be tackled by considering different models depending on the length and time scale. Without taking into account the gyroscopic motion of the charged particles around the magnetic field and neglecting the interaction between the particles and the fields still provide a way to distinguish between different regions of the plasma in the stellarator. Following the movement of a point in the direction of $\textbf{B}$ (forward) or $-\textbf{B}$ (backward) gives is called field line tracing (FLT). It is usually used to draw the intersections or to view the connection length plot and provides significant amount of information about a configuration.

In the more general case of a 3 dimensional vector field, \cite{wei_invariant_2023} describes the FLT in cylindrical coordinates as a map that shows the evolution of the crossing of a field line with a constant toroidal angle semi-plane. The resulting map, which I will call the field line or Poincaré map,  is shown to have a determinant related to the divergence of the vector field. If the configuration is chaotic, then the trajectories depend strongly on the initial conditions, and two almost indistinguishably close initial conditions will eventually evolve into noticeably different regions of phase space. H. Poincaré was a precursor in this regard, looking at chaos in the case of celestial mechanics for the three-body problem. He associated chaotic behaviour with the appearance of an infinitely refined lattice structure, which he called a trellis in analogy with the construction of the interconnected garden fence \cite[Ch.33]{poincare_methodes_1892}. Nowadays it is also called a tangle. The trellis structure arises when looking at some specific points that are part of periodic orbits and is formed by the interconnection of two curves, the unstable and the stable manifold of one or more hyperbolic fixed point.

As \cite{wei_invariant_2023} put it : "With the aid of modern dynamical system theory, the structure of a 3D vector field can be comprehended and analyzed in terms of invariant manifolds". In their paper they then show a hypothetical tangle in the case of an EAST shot when an RMP induced field would be added. In the case of field line tracing, we can analyse the 3-dimensional manifolds and tangle structure in a cross section with the field line map.

The field line map is continuous, but is a non-trivial problem: there is no general analytical formula, it can be lengthy to perform FLT, and the integration is prone to error. These difficulties make the study of the field line map not the best playground for understanding chaos.  Simpler analytical maps are then a nice alternative and in particular the symmetric and asymmetric Tokamaps have been introduce to describe FLT in Tokamaks \cite{abdullaev_mappings_2006}. There are based on a continous Hamiltonian system which consists in an integrable part specified by the winding profile, more precisely the safety factor $q$ profile, and a non-integrable perturbation. \figref{fig:tokamap} shows the orbits of the symmetric tokamap for a perturbed monotonic $q$ profile. We can clearly see the difference between the region where the field lines form closed surfaces, the magnetic islands, and the regions where the points get mixed up, the chaotic zone. In fact, there may still remain some invariant tori in the chaotic sea. They are called cantori and their existence is proven by the KAM theorem.

Progress has been made in understanding chaos, for instance  \cite{easton_transport_1991} began to describe transport. For volume-preserving\footnote{Here the volume is a more general definition that can mean for instance the conservation of the magnetic flux in the case of the field line map.} maps, \cite{meiss_thirty_2015} provides the advances made. He looks at the well-studied Chirkov standard map, which the degree of chaos can be set through the parameter $K$. A phase portrait for $K=0.68$ can be seen in \figref{fig:standard-map}. In fact, the stable and unstable manifold curves are shown to bound a resonance region where the island lies, and for which there is an exit $E$ and an entry $I$ region. These exiting and entering sets are bounded between manifold intersections. The `sizes' of the two sets are equal, there is as much flux coming from outside the resonance zone through the entry set as there is going out through the exit set. By the similarity with a turnstile gates, the lobes are then called turnstiles. The size of the turnstile is more relevant for transport than another common quantity look at in chaos which is the Lyapunov exponent. Meiss puts it as~:
\begin{quote}
``It is important to note that one of the fundamental measures of chaos, the Lyapunov exponent is not usually a good measure for transport. In Ref. 86, we said: The Lyapunov exponents give the rate at which a nice cat in a region of phase space turns into a mixed-up cat. The turnstile rate constants give the mean rate at which bits of the cat are transported to regions of the phase space''
\end{quote}

Finally, it is worth noting that experimental signatures of turnstiles and tangles have been demonstrated \cite{evans_experimental_2005}. According to the authors' calculations, the pattern of chaotic magnetic field lines hits on the vessel is related to the arrangement of the perturbed system tangles and experiments in which heat and particle distributions were measured on the PFC sometimes exhibited split peaks, indicating the presence of chaotic fields and homoclinic tangles.
