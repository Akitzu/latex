\chapter{Conclusion}
IN this work using meiss we laid the theoretical ground of algorithmically computing the turnstile area for a field given by a magnetical configuration. 

A robust method of calculating the turnstile fluxes was presented and


it will be usefull for stellarator optimization, the calculation of the turnstile flux is robust however the challange is to know what are the 

while the process was performed by hand a not too difficult it requires with a sufficient tolerance of the algorithm no more than 10 minutes, which, if a robust way would fast and relevant way of caluating chaos 

algorithm that records robustly
