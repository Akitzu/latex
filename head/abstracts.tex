In magnetically confined devices intended for fusion, it is common to witness sensitivity to initial conditions, i.e. chaotic behaviour. In the particular case of divertor design, it can be useful to trace field line and compute Poincaré/connection length plots. A map $\pmap$ that sends point from Poincaré section to the next is hereby defined. The chaos is then look at in term of the unstable/stable manifold tangle structure for saddle fixed point of $\pmap$. Following previous work from \cite{meiss_thirty_2015} in the case of the Chirikov standard map, the turnstile flux, an important quantity to measure transport and the degree of chaos, is calculated in a Toy model. The method is then used to compute the turnstile fluxes in 3 configurations from the QUASR database and, finally, to look at the case of a chaotic configuration of W7X obtained by running current in the planar coils.
