I would especially like to thank Christopher Berg Smiet and Joachim Loizu for their precious guidance and advice. I would also like to thank Erol Balkovic and Jérémy Salm for creating a wonderful working environment. I would like to thank Robert Davies for his support, for giving me the opportunity to present this work in a CWGM NRD JA seminar, and for the W7X data, which has proved to be a very interesting part of the analysis. Thanks to Matt Landerman for his well-structured code and insightful suggestions.

On a more personal note, I would like to thank my parents, brother, family and friends, especially Kent, Salomon, Gauthier, Jérémy, JP and Giuseppe for their companionship and support.

Finally, I would like to thank Sabine, Jamy, Fred and la petite voix, as well as Professor Edgidy, Dechenaux, Chanson and Felix for encouraging my curiosity.
